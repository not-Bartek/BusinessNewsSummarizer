      "Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2026 00:00:40 GMT\n",
      "Content: President Trump's favourite word is tariffs. He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas \"address to the nation\". With the world still unwrapping the tariffs \"gift\" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US. That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although \"the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced\", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth to slow to 3.1% in 2026. A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year. For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are \"better than we feared, worse than it needs to be\". Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%. \"This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,\" she said. Other forecasts for 2026 are even more pessimistic than that of the IMF. Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because \"countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US\". Obstfeld adds: \"And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster.\" However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have more tariffs and other trade restrictions in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time. The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future. Despite the resilience seen so far, \"these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time\", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld. Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain. This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach more than $35tn (£26tn). Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. \"The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them.\" Countries including the UK, South Korea and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump. Others will hope they can do so during 2026. Whilst some economists have expressed doubt about how strongly the US is now growing, between July and September it expanded by 4.3%, the strongest annual growth in two years. \"This is a very, very resilient economy, and I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" says Aditya Bhave, a senior economist at Bank of America. He thinks tariffs have added between 0.3% and 0.5% to US inflation, which in November was 2.7%, but \"we probably haven't seen the full impact\" yet.  That matters given the US economy is driven by consumer spending, and that it accounts for 26% of the global economy, according to the IMF. Cost of living pressures are still a problem for people in many parts of the world, but there are some encouraging signs for them. In the eurozone, inflation has stabilised and is now running at 2.1%. But in the UK it's 3.2%, which as in the US, remains well above the central banks' 2% target. Others major influences on the global economy this year could include the renegotiation of the US Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that Trump signed in his first term in office. Meanwhile, EU member states are due to vote on whether to ratify a South American trade deal that was signed more than a year ago. And back in the US, there is a lot riding on a Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump's tariffs. One key input into the world economy is oil, and Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs expects the price of benchmark Brent Crude to fall around 8% this year to around $56 a barrel. That forecast is based on strong production in the US and Russia, rather than Trump's intervention in Venezuela, which is unlikely to lead to more oil on global markets in the short term. With oil used for energy and transport, another downward pressure on prices could be the resumption of global shipping through the Red Sea. A week before Christmas shipping giant Maersk sent a container ship through it for the first time in almost two years. Attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, that were linked to the war in Gaza, mean major shipping companies have avoided it. Instead they've taken the longer and more expensive route around southern Africa. Maersk says that whilst it was \"a significant step forward, we are not at a point where we can set a date on any potential wider network change back to the trans-Suez corridor\". One of the most important destinations for container ships is China. It's where they pick up the toys, electronics, clothing and other goods that the country makes for the rest of the world. However, Beijing's trade relations with the US continue to cast a shadow over the global economy. The latest available data suggests the value of goods the world's two biggest economies sold each other fell for the third consecutive year in 2025. Unlike a year ago, there wasn't even a nod towards those strains, or the many domestic economic pressures in President Xi's 2026 new year message. However, he did forecast the world's second-biggest economy would reach the landmark size of $20tn this year, and said that China is \"ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development\". Tariffs, US sourcing of rare earth metals, and Chinese access to high-end US computer chips, have dominated talks between the two sides, but there are many other issues to be resolved when Xi hosts Trump in April, according to James Zimmerman who chairs the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \"A lot is riding on that [meeting],\" he says. \"Our expectations are indeed low.\" But he adds that its \"very, very important\" that there is a sustained dialogue even if it takes time to deliver results. \"Beijing wants a fair shake at being able to compete globally. They do feel that the environment in certain places has been very restrictive towards Chinese companies. Part of that is the over emphasis on security concerns.\" On the other side, Zimmerman says that US concerns include \"how China manages its manufacturing output\". \"Overcapacity is an issue that is affecting a lot of different economies.\" He explains that China has shown its strength in manufacturing consumer goods, but that it needs to show it can make adjustments when demand for them falls, \"so that there is not a situation where you have massive dumping of consumer goods around the world\". In Europe, the continent's reliance on cheap Chinese imports is growing, according to research from Dutch bank ING. This is something that the EU is looking to crack down on in the coming months. Back in the US, limiting the inflow of foreign-made goods is a key part of Trump's trade policy. His Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently wrote that re-industrialisation and increasing \"manufacturing's share of our economy\" was in the US national interest. In a hint towards tariffs staying in place, he argued that new investments in making cars, ships and pharmaceuticals in the US wouldn't be happening without them. However, since Trump's second term began, the number of Americans in manufacturing jobs has fallen slightly to just under 12.7 million. Obstfeld says that despite tariffs the US economy has continued to grow because of \"resilient consumers who want to spend their money anyway\", and the huge investment in AI that has sent stock markets to record highs.

      "Title: Why this month's inflation figure may be good news for you\n",
      "Date: Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:18:10 GMT\n",
      "Content: On the face of it, there is relatively little festive cheer for your finances in the latest inflation figures. Prices have risen by 3.2% compared with a year ago. If you filled your virtual shopping bag with goods and services at a cost of £100 a year ago, the same selection will now cost £103.20. The rate of rising prices is well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, and some items are still rocketing up in price. Chocolate, arguably central to the family diet at Christmas, is 17% more expensive than a year ago. But, crucially, there are now clear signs that prices are going up at a slower rate. That bodes well for next year, and more immediately for the cost of borrowing. And, with essentials driving the slowdown, the latest data will be welcomed by those who feel particularly stretched by the cost of living. The rate of inflation, which charts the rising cost of living, has overcome its recent mini-peak, according to analysts. The mountainous height of inflation was in October 2022 when the rate hit 11.1%. The rate then fell, but there was an uptick in the late summer of 2025, reaching 3.8%. And it was the price of food - an essential for consumers - driving November's drop in inflation. Food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 4.2% in the year to November, compared to 4.9% in October. Alcohol and tobacco were up 4% compared to 5.9% in October. Moving in the opposite direction to chocolate, and beef and veal (which rose by nearly 28% in a year), were olive oil (down 16%) as well as drops in price for flours, pasta and sugar. Importantly, food is essential spending. When the price rises slow, this is much better news for those on lower incomes who see a bigger proportion of their income spent on things that it is impossible to do without. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said this was also helping the overall inflation rate drop faster than expected: \"It has been following the path the Bank of England had forecast - peaking in September and gradually moving south.\" The reasons for slowing price rises are often specific to individual items. For example, the drop in the price of olive oil is primarily the result of a recovery in harvests after some particularly bad years of heatwaves and drought in Greece and Turkey. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.6% in the year to November compared to a rise of 0.3% in October. This has been linked to shops bringing forward Black Friday discounts due to weak sales as shoppers struggle with the cost of living pressures.  Consumers, too, have changed their habits owing to the financial climate of recent years. Lucy Fairs, who helps run a cake-sharing social club, called Band of Bakers in Camberwell, London, said that, over the last five years, they had started using what they already had in their cupboards, rather than buying extra special ingredients. \"When I chose a recipe for today, I thought of the theme - but, more so, I thought of what I already had in my pantry,\" said club member Costa Christou. The rising cost of goods and services has an impact on the money you save or earn. Inflation erodes the spending power of money you've got saved and - unless you get a pay rise - of your salary. Analysts say the latest inflation data strengthens the likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday. That should make it cheaper for consumers to borrow money, but bring lower returns for savers. \"Lower inflation is good news for household budgets, but it is a different story for savers,\" said Sally Conway, savings commentator at Shawbrook Bank.  \"Some savings will inevitably take a hit over Christmas. The key is what happens next. Once the dust settles, it's worth checking whether remaining cash is working hard enough.\" Policymakers are trying to encourage more people to invest their money in stocks and shares - which they say is likely to bring higher returns over time than cash savings. It is why the Financial Conduct Authority has given the go-ahead for targeted support - a scheme that, for the first time, allows banks and financial firms to give suggestions about where to invest your money.

The rain and high winds experienced during stormy weather can damage homes and cause power outages. An increasing number of people cannot afford to heat their homes in winter, says a  charity boss. Paying parents directly for some childcare costs gives \"flexibility\", says a Jersey minister.  Trump's import levies are still changing the patterns of international trade. Copyright 2026 BBC.

      "Title: US job creation in 2025 slows to weakest since Covid\n",
      "Date: Fri, 09 Jan 2026 18:55:43 GMT\n",
      "Content: The number of jobs created in the US grew only modestly in December, as a weak year for the employment market in the world's largest economy drew to a close.  Employers added 50,000 jobs in the final month of 2025, according to Labor Department data, which was fewer than expected. But the unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%. Job gains last year were the smallest since 2020, when the Covid pandemic led to widespread cuts. Businesses have been operating in an environment marked by US President Donald Trump's dramatic policy changes, including tariffs, an immigration crackdown and cuts to government spending. The US economy has held up in the face of these shifts, growing at an annual rate of 4.3% over the three months to September.  But the expansion - driven by steady consumer spending and a growth in exports - has not been accompanied by significant job creation.  On average, the US added an average of just 49,000 roles per month in 2025, down from an estimated gain of 168,000 a month the year before. The Labor Department said the US also added 76,000 fewer new positions in October and November than previously estimated. Retailers and manufacturers were among the sectors reporting losses last month, which were offset by hiring at health care employers, bars and restaurants. The data underscores the mixed dynamics facing job-seekers in the US, where hiring has cooled markedly over the last year but fears of mass layoffs have not materialised.  The US Federal Reserve central bank has responded to the slowdown by cutting its key lending rate in hopes of giving the economy a boost. The central bank trimmed interest rates three times last year starting in September, despite concerns that inflation is still bubbling. Its key lending rate is now hovering around 3.6%, which is the lowest level in three years.  But policymakers are divided about how much lower borrowing costs should go.  Analysts said the latest figures would do little to resolve those debates. The jobless rate, which had jumped in November to 4.5%, fell back last month to 4.4%, where it stood in September. \"Today's report confirms what we think has been evident for some time—the labour market is no longer working in favour of job seekers,\" said Ellen Zentner, chief economic strategist for Morgan Stanley Wealth Management. But she added: \"Until the data provide a clearer direction, a divided Fed is likely to stay that way. Lower rates are likely coming this year, but the markets may have to be patient.\" The monthly jobs report is among the most closely watched pieces of economic data reported by the US government. Its publication has traditionally been strictly guarded, out of fears that some people could use early access to the information for financial gain.  That dynamic is one of the reasons why in some circles, a social media post by Trump on Thursday that incorporated some of the then-unpublished data, drew almost as much attention as the report itself.  Almost 300 jobs are to be scrapped at Consumer Energy Services (CES) in Swansea and Treorchy. Car crash victim Nick Atherton says he lost some of his inhibitions since suffering the injury.

      "Title: Budget 2025: What's the best and worst that could happen for Labour?\n",
      "Date: Sat, 29 Nov 2025 15:14:47 GMT\n",
      "Content: Any big red box moment is risky. And for a government disliked by millions there's peril at every turn. Now the chancellor's big choices are out there, what's the best-case scenario for Reeves and Starmer, and what's the worst that could happen next? On the positive side of the ledger, Labour MPs have gone off to their constituencies in a better mood this week. That is in large part down to the chancellor's decision to scrap the limit on bigger families getting some extra benefits. The prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it's not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. He'll also make the case the Budget will help families by easing energy bills and freezing rail fares. And the long-awaited strategy on child poverty will likely see the light of day towards the end of the week. It's about as clear an example of a Labour-friendly policy as there could be - redistributing taxpayers' cash to the least well-off. One government source described it as a \"restatement of values, something that MPs wanted to see, government being more bold about what it believes in and what a Labour government is\". In other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job. While it's not a policy that is universally popular with the public, the decision makes it easier for the leadership to get their backbenchers on board and manage the party. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it's solving a problem they ought never to have had. A reliable party is a basic for any government that wants to be effective. And it shouldn't be an issue for an administration with a huge majority. But you don't need me to remind you Labour's time in office has been eventful at best, chaotic at worst, with the leadership unable to keep its MPs in line. In the best-case scenario, the changes to benefits in the Budget gives Labour a clearer identity, an argument in the party's comfort zone that it's happy to make. From a political point of view, another government source says \"there'll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight.\" If - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. The hope is that would unlock cash for the economy, despite big tax rises, big increases on welfare spending and the country's still whopping debts. After all the preparation (more on the dark side of it later), there was no big meltdown in the markets on the day. Remember, market reaction matters because the government borrows lots and lots of money from investors who want it back one day. Business leaders hope seeming stability hangs around and endless politicking ends. As one says: \"Best-case scenario is this gives stability - the government can crack on, and we see an uptick [in the economy]. It's not like other governments globally are smashing it.\" Another boss of a company worth billions told me: \"Twenty-six billion of extra tax is not normal, but I think the Budget will settle things down. We all love to criticise but maybe it is time to cut them some slack.\" The polls do not suggest for a second that the public at large is in the mood to do that. Early surveys of opinion after the Budget give Reeves's plans short shrift. More than a million people will be paying more income tax or paying it for the first time - not a traditional reason for cheer. Inflation is expected to be higher for this year than expected. And the growth in people's spending power is predicted to be \"dismal\". But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario \"has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May\", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer's job is expected to hang in the balance. The Budget has not brought that moment of jeopardy any closer, which given how rocky things have been, is a win of sorts. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: \"The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge.\" What about the worst-case scenario? The ink on the Budget headlines was barely dry when along came another political fuss about a partial u-turn on expanding workers' rights. For some in the party, the timing was incomprehensible - one senior figure told me, exasperated: \"in terms of managing your party, why do it this week? You'd calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!\" Separate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they'd been unfairly sacked. For some in the unions and the party, dropping day-one protection from unfair dismissal was a necessary compromise to make sure the bigger changes to workers' rights could pass through Parliament. But it has angered some on the left. A source close to the talks with the unions and business told me \"you can't grid the negotiations\" - in other words, the announcement couldn't be fitted into a neat government timetable. The partial climbdown is not likely to result in an enormous bust-up – one of Angela Rayner's steadfast allies who pioneered the wider plans said they were a \"little concerned\" rather than frothing with rage. But the spat punctures any suggestion that the Budget will end grumps and strops inside the party. And listen to this warning from another source in the Labour movement: \"It's a ludicrous thing to have done – it was a clear manifesto pledge. It's not complicated and it's made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections.\" In other words, leadership watch out. For all the political focus, the Budget is of course also a huge economic moment and it simply isn't pretty. Debt is still sky-high. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. State spending, particularly on welfare, is going up and up. It's hard to reconcile that with Reeves and Starmer's language before and after the general election: that helping business make money and hire more people - growth - was at the top of their list. One city figure told me: \"The left side of Labour might hate business but that's what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows.\" Another senior business figure told me: \"I think we are bit screwed aren't we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list.\" The minimum wage is going up. Business rates are going up for many companies. Even one union figure told me \"growth's gone as a priority\". For one city insider, there is a sense that Reeves's effort to play nice with the business community before the election had been for nothing. \"They've sacrificed any opportunity they had to really drive growth, support aspiration and build an economy around thriving businesses and entrepreneurship in favour of saving their jobs. Taxpayers and business have been betrayed and both have long memories. \"All of the pre-election talk about being the party of business and growth was bullshit. Everyone recognises that now and they won't forget.\" Government figures dispute this. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: \"If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it's quite a good idea those children don't go hungry when they are growing up.\" Starmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it's always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Downing Street insiders suggest it's bogus to suggest the new focus on child poverty means they're not interested in helping business grow any more. Multiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values. One former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992. But in the worst-case scenario, the economy remains on a measly path. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean \"everyone will just not hire - there's nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it.\" The Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. But the official predictions at the moment do not make for reassuring reading. Lastly, decisions in the Budget might bash the public's trust in the government even further. That's not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party's election manifesto. And Reeves also stands accused of lying about how short of cash the government really was in the run up to the Budget. Repeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. put your taxes up. This impression was created over many weeks, so tax rises didn't come as a massive shock to you or the markets. Some leaks were accidental. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking more rosy than had been expected. Here's the rub. What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn't actually a hole in her finances after all. The Conservatives have blasted her for \"lying\" about the numbers. Downing Street has flat-out denied that. But even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: \"Everyone knows the game, but there's a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby.\" In the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face. Budgets can unravel spectacularly, fall apart before your eyes. That has not happened this week. Given how bad things have been for this government in the last few months, that fact alone will be a relief. And Labour has emerged with a sharper political identity that's relieved many in its rank and file. But that's not the same as pleasing the public. The financial picture doesn't give much cheer. In the end, there may not be much economic comfort in the political comfort zone.

      "Title: Government to water down business rate rise for pubs\n",
      "Date: Thu, 08 Jan 2026 19:10:16 GMT\n",
      "Content: A climbdown on forthcoming increases to the business rates bills faced by pubs in England is set to be announced by the government in the next few days. The government is expected to say it will make changes to how pubs' business rates are calculated, resulting in smaller rises to bills. Treasury officials say they have recognised the financial difficulties facing many pubs after sharp rises in the rateable value of their premises. The move follows pressure from landlords and industry groups that included more than 1,000 pubs banning Labour MPs from their premises. The BBC understands it will apply only to pubs and not the whole hospitality sector. The Treasury is also thought to be ready to relax licensing rules to allow longer opening and more pavement areas for drinking. In her November Budget, Chancellor Rachel Reeves scaled back business rate discounts that have been in force since the pandemic from 75% to 40% - and announced that there would be no discount at all from April. That, combined with big upward adjustments to rateable values of pub premises, left landlords with the prospect of much higher rates bills. A campaign to dilute the impact of these rises has been gaining traction in recent weeks, with pub owners and industry groups lobbying for more support. Conversations between the government and the hospitality sector were \"ongoing\", DWP minister Dame Diana Johnson said. Speaking to Radio 4's PM programme, she said: \"We as a government want to make business rates fairer but you'll also know we're coming to the end of the transitional relief that was available because of Covid.\" On Wednesday Labour MPs called on the government to rethink its support for the industry. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said: \"What has happened is that over Christmas Labour MPs were banned from every single pub they tried to get into... so now they are pushing for a U-turn.\" She said the Conservatives had a \"much better plan\" which was to \"slash business rates for all of the High Street, not just pubs\". She said business rates bills of less than £110,000 would be scrapped completely. Reform also welcomed the climbdown, saying \"pubs have already been lumbered with astronomical energy costs\". The party's deputy leader Richard Tice said: \"Pubs are the backbone of our communities and a huge part of British heritage. Their closures would be a cultural catastrophe as much as an economic one.\" To calculate a pub's business rate bill the rateable value of its premises is multiplied by a set figure: \"the multiplier\". The government had already offered some relief by reducing the multiplier for pubs, and may be about to reduce it further. Alternatively they could boost the £4.3bn \"transitional relief\" fund brought in to ease the impact of withdrawing support following the pandemic. Geoff Robbins, who owns the Wheatsheaf Pub in Faringdon, Oxfordshire with his wife Jo, said it was \"a great relief\" that more help was on the way. His rates are due to rise by around 80% over the next three years. He needs a discount on most of that, he reckons, after factoring in higher gas, electricity and staffing costs. \"Rates are a tax against your business whether you make a profit or loss...  you've got to pay, there's no way round it,\" said Geoff, who got in touch with BBC Your Voice. Industry groups also welcomed news there would be additional help. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association, said it was \"potentially a huge win\" for the sector. \"This could save locals, jobs, and means publicans can breathe a huge sigh of relief,\" she said. Kate Nicholls, chair of UK Hospitality, representing the industry, said the support should apply not just to pubs, but to all hospitality businesses affected by rising rates, including cafés and restaurants. \"We need a hospitality-wide solution, which is why the government should implement the maximum possible 20p discount to the multiplier for all hospitality properties,\" she said. Other sectors are calling for the support to be even broader, to include live music venues, theatres, galleries, gyms and retailers. Unpicking the recent Budget would be seen by many as another U-turn following climbdowns on winter fuel payments, disability benefits and inheritance tax on farms and family businesses. Shadow business and trade secretary Andrew Griffith said the change showed Rachel Reeves' Budget was \"falling apart\". \"Labour were wrong to attack pubs and now have been forced into another screeching U-turn,\" he said. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper said: \"This is literally the last chance saloon for our treasured pubs and high streets - so the government must U-turn, today. \"These businesses are worried sick, making decisions now, and can't wait a minute longer.\" The calculation of business rates is an issue that is devolved in all four UK nations. The discount on rates during the pandemic only applied to hospitality businesses in England. Scottish businesses are waiting for the Budget there next week to hear how the  Edinburgh government will approach the issue. Pubs there will hope the Scottish government follows the UK government in offering some relief. Additional reporting by Kris Bramwell Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.

      "Based on the provided articles, inflation in 2026 is expected to be influenced by several conflicting factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "**United Kingdom**\n",
      "*   **General Trend:** In late 2025, UK inflation stood at 3.2%, which is above the Bank of England's 2% target. However, analysts note clear signs that prices are rising at a slower rate, and the Bank of England forecasts that inflation will move \"gradually south\" (decrease) during 2026.\n",
      "*   **Upward Pressures:** The 2025 Budget was expected to result in higher inflation than previously anticipated. Additionally, businesses like pubs have faced \"astronomical\" energy and staffing costs.\n",
      "*   **Downward Pressures:** Food price increases have begun to slow, with items like olive oil dropping in price due to recovered harvests.\n",
      "\n",
      "**United States**\n",
      "*   **Tariff Impact:** Senior economist Aditya Bhave (Bank of America) estimates that tariffs have added between 0.3% and 0.5% to US inflation, which was 2.7% in November 2025. He suggests the \"full impact\" of these tariffs may not have been seen yet heading into 2026.\n",
      "*   **Economic Context:** While the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in 2025 to boost a cooling labor market, policymakers remain divided because inflation is still \"bubbling.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "**Global Factors**\n",
      "*   **Oil Prices:** Goldman Sachs expects the price of benchmark Brent Crude to fall by approximately 8% in 2026 to around $56 a barrel, driven by strong production in the US and Russia. Since oil is used for energy and transport, this would exert downward pressure on global prices.\n",
      "*   **Shipping:** The potential resumption of global shipping through the Red Sea (Suez corridor) is cited as another possible downward pressure on prices, as it avoids longer and more expensive routes around southern Africa.\n",
      "*   **Trade Disruptions:** While \"trade disaster\" was avoided in 2025, ongoing trade restrictions and tariffs between the US and China have pushed up costs for many businesses and created efficiency losses, which take a toll over time.\n"

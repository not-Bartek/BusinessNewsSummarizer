      "Content: President Trump's favourite word is tariffs. He reminded the world of that in his pre-Christmas \"address to the nation\". With the world still unwrapping the tariffs \"gift\" from the first year of his second term in office, he said they were bringing jobs, higher wages and economic growth to the US. That is hotly contested. What is less debatable is that they've refashioned the global economy, and will continue to do so into 2026. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) says that although \"the tariff shock is smaller than originally announced\", it is a key reason why it now expects the rate of global economic growth to slow to 3.1% in 2026. A year ago, it predicted a 3.3% expansion this year. For the head of the IMF, Kristalina Georgieva, things are \"better than we feared, worse than it needs to be\". Speaking on a podcast recently she explained that growth had fallen from a pre-Covid average of 3.7%. \"This growth is too slow to meet the aspirations of people around the world for better lives,\" she said. Other forecasts for 2026 are even more pessimistic than that of the IMF. Yet the impact of the tariffs on the global economy was not as bad as it could have been, notes Maurice Obstfeld of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who is also a former chief economist at the IMF. He says this is the case because \"countries didn't retaliate strongly against the US\". Obstfeld adds: \"And the one country that did forcefully hit back, which is China, induced the US to back down very quickly. So we certainly avoided a trade disaster.\" However, after five rounds of trade talks, the world's two biggest economies still have more tariffs and other trade restrictions in place against each other than when Trump took office for the second time. The tariffs have pushed up costs for many businesses and increased uncertainty, which makes it harder to plan for and invest in the future. Despite the resilience seen so far, \"these frictions and uncertainties take their toll over time\", such as through efficiency loses, according to Obstfeld. Some of the damage of tariffs has been mitigated by lower interest rates, a fall in the value of the dollar, businesses finding clever ways around them, and, crucially, the many exemptions they contain. This may help explain why the UN trade agency UNCTAD is forecasting that the value of global trade grew 7% last year to reach more than $35tn (£26tn). Yet Obstfeld says the loopholes in US tariffs are a double-edged sword. \"The exemptions mean lower tariffs in practice, but they also introduce a lot of uncertainty about how you get them.\" Countries including the UK, South Korea and Japan have managed to navigate those mysteries and agree trade deals with Trump. Others will hope they can do so during 2026. Whilst some economists have expressed doubt about how strongly the US is now growing, between July and September it expanded by 4.3%, the strongest annual growth in two years. \"This is a very, very resilient economy, and I don't see why that wouldn't continue going forward,\" says Aditya Bhave, a senior economist at Bank of America. He thinks tariffs have added between 0.3% and 0.5% to US inflation, which in November was 2.7%, but \"we probably haven't seen the full impact\" yet.  That matters given the US economy is driven by consumer spending, and that it accounts for 26% of the global economy, according to the IMF. Cost of living pressures are still a problem for people in many parts of the world, but there are some encouraging signs for them. In the eurozone, inflation has stabilised and is now running at 2.1%. But in the UK it's 3.2%, which as in the US, remains well above the central banks' 2% target. Others major influences on the global economy this year could include the renegotiation of the US Mexico Canada Agreement (USMCA) trade deal that Trump signed in his first term in office. Meanwhile, EU member states are due to vote on whether to ratify a South American trade deal that was signed more than a year ago. And back in the US, there is a lot riding on a Supreme Court decision on the legality of Trump's tariffs. One key input into the world economy is oil, and Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs expects the price of benchmark Brent Crude to fall around 8% this year to around $56 a barrel. That forecast is based on strong production in the US and Russia, rather than Trump's intervention in Venezuela, which is unlikely to lead to more oil on global markets in the short term. With oil used for energy and transport, another downward pressure on prices could be the resumption of global shipping through the Red Sea. A week before Christmas shipping giant Maersk sent a container ship through it for the first time in almost two years. Attacks by Houthi rebels based in Yemen, that were linked to the war in Gaza, mean major shipping companies have avoided it. Instead they've taken the longer and more expensive route around southern Africa. Maersk says that whilst it was \"a significant step forward, we are not at a point where we can set a date on any potential wider network change back to the trans-Suez corridor\". One of the most important destinations for container ships is China. It's where they pick up the toys, electronics, clothing and other goods that the country makes for the rest of the world. However, Beijing's trade relations with the US continue to cast a shadow over the global economy. The latest available data suggests the value of goods the world's two biggest economies sold each other fell for the third consecutive year in 2025. Unlike a year ago, there wasn't even a nod towards those strains, or the many domestic economic pressures in President Xi's 2026 new year message. However, he did forecast the world's second-biggest economy would reach the landmark size of $20tn this year, and said that China is \"ready to work with all countries to advance world peace and development\". Tariffs, US sourcing of rare earth metals, and Chinese access to high-end US computer chips, have dominated talks between the two sides, but there are many other issues to be resolved when Xi hosts Trump in April, according to James Zimmerman who chairs the American Chamber of Commerce in China. \"A lot is riding on that [meeting],\" he says. \"Our expectations are indeed low.\" But he adds that its \"very, very important\" that there is a sustained dialogue even if it takes time to deliver results. \"Beijing wants a fair shake at being able to compete globally. They do feel that the environment in certain places has been very restrictive towards Chinese companies. Part of that is the over emphasis on security concerns.\" On the other side, Zimmerman says that US concerns include \"how China manages its manufacturing output\". \"Overcapacity is an issue that is affecting a lot of different economies.\" He explains that China has shown its strength in manufacturing consumer goods, but that it needs to show it can make adjustments when demand for them falls, \"so that there is not a situation where you have massive dumping of consumer goods around the world\". In Europe, the continent's reliance on cheap Chinese imports is growing, according to research from Dutch bank ING. This is something that the EU is looking to crack down on in the coming months. Back in the US, limiting the inflow of foreign-made goods is a key part of Trump's trade policy. His Trade Representative Jamieson Greer recently wrote that re-industrialisation and increasing \"manufacturing's share of our economy\" was in the US national interest. In a hint towards tariffs staying in place, he argued that new investments in making cars, ships and pharmaceuticals in the US wouldn't be happening without them. However, since Trump's second term began, the number of Americans in manufacturing jobs has fallen slightly to just under 12.7 million. Obstfeld says that despite tariffs the US economy has continued to grow because of \"resilient consumers who want to spend their money anyway\", and the huge investment in AI that has sent stock markets to record highs. With some of Trump's key policy aims, such as creating new manufacturing jobs, still to be achieved Obstfeld adds: \"I don't think tariffs are going to go away as a matter of policy or of discussion.\" The president also called on defence firms to increase production or face a crackdown on payouts. Why scientists in Cambridge are \"optimistic\" they can improve our lives and the UK economy in 2026. The chip giant is looking for ways to move the AI revolution beyond software and into physical products. The firm plans to deploy the technology at the same plant that was involved in a huge immigration raid in 2025.

      "Title: Trump says Venezuela will be 'turning over' up to 50 million barrels of oil to US\n",
      "Date: Wed, 07 Jan 2026 10:10:24 GMT\n",
      "Content: Donald Trump has said Venezuela \"will be turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, after a military operation to remove President Nicolás Maduro from power. The oil - worth about $2.8bn (£2.1bn) - will be sold at its market price, the US president wrote on social media, adding he would control the money raised and use it to benefit the people of Venezuela and the US. His comments come after he said the US oil industry would be \"up and running\" in Venezuela within 18 months and that he expected huge investments to pour into the country. Analysts previously told the BBC it could take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to restore Venezuela's former output. China, which has been the biggest buyer of Venezuelan oil in recent years, has condemned Trump's announcement as well as the US's reported demands that Venezuela gives its oil exclusively to them. ABC News has reported, citing unnamed sources, that Trump had told Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez to agree to an exclusive partnership with the US on oil production and sever economic ties with China, Russia, Iran and Cuba. Trump posted on Truth Social on Tuesday: \"I am pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America.  \"This Oil will be sold at its Market Price, and that money will be controlled by me, as President of the United States of America, to ensure it is used to benefit the people of Venezuela and the United States!\" His comment came a day after Rodríguez, formerly Venezuela's vice-president, was sworn in as its interim president. Maduro has been brought to the US to face drug-trafficking and weapons charges. The US president told NBC News on Monday: \"Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down.\" Representatives from major US petroleum companies planned to meet the Trump administration this week, the BBC's US news partner CBS reported. Analysts who previously spoke to the BBC were sceptical that Trump's plans would have a major impact on the global supply - and therefore price - of oil.  They suggested that firms would look for reassurance that a stable government was in place - and, even when they did invest, their projects would not deliver for years.  Trump has argued in recent days that US oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure.  The country has an estimated 303 billion barrels - the world's largest proven reserve - but its oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s. The Trump administration sees significant potential for its own energy prospects in Venezuela's reserves. Increasing the country's production of oil would be expensive for US firms.  Venezuelan oil is also heavy and more difficult to refine. There is only one US firm, Chevron, currently operating in the country. Asked for comment about Trump's plans for US oil production in Venezuela, Chevron spokesman Bill Turenne said the company \"remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets\". \"We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,\" he added. ConocoPhillips, a major US oil company that no longer has a presence in Venezuela, \"is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability\", said spokesman Dennis Nuss. \"It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.\" A third company, Exxon, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning said on Wednesday that the US's \"blatant military action against Venezuela, and its demand that Venezuela prioritise the US in disposing of its oil resources, is a typical act of bullying, a serious violation of international law, a severe infringement upon Venezuela's sovereignty, and a grave damage to the rights of the Venezuelan people\". She added: \"I want to emphasise that the legitimate rights and interests of China and other countries in Venezuela must be protected... Co-operation between China and Venezuela is the co-operation between two sovereign states, which is under protection of international law and the domestic laws of the two countries.\" While justifying the seizure of Maduro from Caracas, Trump also claimed that Venezuela \"unilaterally seized and stole American oil\". Vice-President JD Vance echoed those claims on X after Maduro was taken, writing that \"Venezuela expropriated American oil property and until recently used that stolen property to get rich and fund their narcoterrorist activities\". The reality is more complex.  US oil companies have a long history in Venezuela, extracting oil under licence agreements. Venezuela nationalised its oil industry in 1976, and in 2007, President Hugo Chavez exerted more state control over the remaining foreign-owned assets of US oil firms operating in the country.  In 2019, a World Bank tribunal ordered Venezuela to pay $8.7bn in compensation to ConocoPhillips for the move. That sum has not been paid by Venezuela, so at least one US oil company has outstanding compensation which is owed to it. But BBC Verify's Ben Chu said the claim Venezuela has \"stolen\" US oil is too simplistic, as experts said the oil itself was never actually owned by anyone except Venezuela. The ownership of natural resources by sovereign nations is considered a key tenet of international law. The incident is threatening to inflame a deeply contentious debate over immigration enforcement. The immigration agency is under scrutiny following the fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. The White House says the decision was taken because those entities \"no longer serve American interests\". European allies of Denmark have rejected Trump's ideas to annex the semi-autonomous territory. The US president's repeated demands to control Greenland could threaten the Nato military alliance.

      "Title: US will control Venezuela oil sales 'indefinitely', official says\n",
      "Date: Wed, 07 Jan 2026 20:31:48 GMT\n",
      "Content: The US will control sales of sanctioned Venezuelan oil \"indefinitely\" as it prepares to roll back restrictions on the country's crude in global markets, the White House said. Officials said sales were expected to start with 30 million to 50 million barrels of oil and the revenue would be controlled by the US government in order to maintain clout over the Venezuelan government. \"We need to have that leverage and control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,\"  Energy Secretary Chris Wright said. It is not clear what portion of the revenues from the sale - which analysts expect to raise about $2.8bn (£2.1bn) - would be shared with Venezuela. While White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the two sides had struck a deal, Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA said in a statement that negotiations over oil sales were ongoing within the framework that exists between the two countries. \"This process is based on similar rules to those in force with international companies,\" it said.  The comments came after US President Donald Trump announced on social media on Tuesday that Venezuela would be \"turning over\" up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US, and it would be sold at its market price.  The White House said the money would be deposited into US-controlled accounts, which Trump said he as president would control and use to benefit the people of Venezuela and the US. White House officials said on Wednesday that they had already taken steps to start marketing the oil and the administration was working with key banks and commodity firms to execute the sales.  As part of the plan, the US is preparing to \"selectively\" roll back sanctions, which have restricted sales of Venezuelan crude for decades. \"We're going to let the oil flow,\" Wright told a conference alongside energy executives in Miami. He added that the money would then \"flow back into Venezuela\".  \"We are not stealing anyone's oil,\" he added later in an appearance on CNBC in which he said the administration's first priority for the funds was to stabilise the country's economy.  US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the aim was to disburse the money \"in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people - not corruption, not the regime - so we have a lot of leverage to move on the stabilisation front\". Analysts said the impact of resuming oil sales would depend on the details. But the plan drew swift criticism from Democrats, with Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut calling it \"insane\".  \"They are talking about stealing the Venezuelan oil at gunpoint for a period of time undefined as leverage to micromanage the country,\" he told reporters. \"The scope and insanity of that plan is absolutely stunning.\" Venezuela has some of the world's largest proven oil reserves, but years of disinvestment, mismanagement and US sanctions have left it with output of only about a million barrels per day - less than 1% of global production.  That supply, which provided critical resources to the Venezuelan government, in recent years has been going primarily to China.  But that too has been disrupted in recent months after the US ramped up strikes and a blockade of Venezuelan tankers as part of its pressure campaign against Maduro.  On Wednesday, Beijing's foreign minister condemned the US seizure of Maduro and US plans to exert control over Venezuela's oil resources.  Trump is due to meet oil executives at the White House on Friday.  Analysts said that in the short term, US oil firm Chevron and US oil refineries, which are set up to process the kind of \"heavy\" crude that is characteristic of Venezuela's output, are well placed to benefit from increased flow of oil from Venezuela. Chevron is the last major US oil firm operating in Venezuela, though some other European firms have outposts there.  The redirection of Venezuelan oil to the US could put pressure on Mexico and Canada, which produce similar crude and are currently the main sellers to US refineries. Oil prices, which are already relatively low amid steady supply and muted demand expectations, slipped further over the last week on the prospect that Venezuela might have increased access to the global market.  But analysts have warned that meaningful expansion of the country's output will take years and billions of dollars in investment, which firms may be hesitant to undertake, given less risky opportunities in the US and in other countries such as Guyana.  French researcher Laurent Vinatier was freed by Moscow in exchange for Russian basketball player Daniil Kasatkin. The incident is threatening to inflame a deeply contentious debate over immigration enforcement. How much attention did you pay to what happened in the world over the past seven days? The immigration agency is under scrutiny following the fatal shooting of Minneapolis woman Renee Nicole Good. Renee Good was fatally shot by an ICE agent in the Central neighbourhood of Minneapolis.\n",

      "Title: How Milei's 'Thatcherite' economics divided his nation - but won over Trump\n",
      "Date: Tue, 14 Oct 2025 12:26:40 GMT\n",
      "Content: Buenos Aires, September 2023. Hundreds of people crowded around to wave flags and film on their phones. The man with unruly hair and sideburns in the centre of them, clad in a black leather jacket, hoisted a roaring chainsaw above his head. This was an election rally taking place in the San Martín area of the Argentine capital a month before the presidential election - and the metaphor was explicit. The candidate Javier Milei believed the state was far too bloated, with annual debts that were bigger than Argentina's entire annual economic output.  Rather than 'trimming the fat', as some politicians delicately put it, he said he would take a chainsaw to ministries, subsidies and the ruling political class he derided as \"la casta\" - the caste. Milei had form for stunts. In 2019, he dressed up in a \"libertarian superhero\" costume, purporting to be from Liberland - a land where no taxes are paid. In 2018, he smashed a piñata of the Central Bank on live television. According to official data, inflation in 2023 topped 211% annually - Milei took office in December of that year. Roughly 40% of the population lived in poverty. Years of high public spending, and a reliance on printing more money and borrowing to cover deficits, had left the country in a cycle of debts and inflation. Yet nearly two years on, the headline figures are vastly different: Argentina recorded its first fiscal surplus in 14 years and inflation, which had hit triple figures annually, has tumbled to roughly 36%. The UK Conservative party leader Kemi Badenoch called the measures Milei has taken a \"template\" for a future Conservative government. And in the US, President Donald Trump described Milei as \"my favourite president\". They will meet in Washington on Tuesday. Foreign investors regained confidence in Argentina too. Although that recently slipped, Washington's decision last week to swap $20bn (£15bn) in dollars for pesos, effectively propping up Argentina's currency with International Monetary Fund (IMF) backing, is a sign Milei's fiscal shock therapy has appeased international lenders. Trump and Milei's meeting will hail the deal. Yet for all the international praise, this is just one side of the story. On the streets there have been heated protests over Milei's reforms, with police firing tear gas, rubber bullets and a water cannon during clashes. \"He said in his campaign that this adjustment would be paid for by 'la casta' – the wealthy, the politicians, the evil businessmen,\" says Mercedes D'Alessandro, a left-wing economist and senate candidate.  But, she argues, the result was less money for pensioners and hospitals. \"The adjustment in the end was directed at the working classes, not the caste.\" Milei's critics argue that the price of his changes have been recession, job losses, weaker public services and declining household budgets. And now some economists say the country could be about to enter a recession. Milei has created a paradox.  On paper, his chainsaw has achieved some of the macroeconomic successes he set out to do. But Milei has lost political support and that has spooked the markets, which in turn has destabilised his economic project. With midterm elections looming on 26 October, Argentina is about to deliver its verdict: will Milei be punished for doing what he set out to do — and could losing political support completely unravel his economic gains? Around 700 miles from the capital in the Misiones province, tea farmer Ygor Sobol looks anxious. \"We're all going backwards economically,\" he says. \"I had to close the payroll. Now I am completely without employees.\" For three generations his family has grown yerba mate, a drink popular with Argentines, but since Milei deregulated his industry by scrapping minimum prices, he says that his crops have become worth less than the cost of producing them. Now, Mr Sobol says he can't afford to do basic tasks like cleaning and fertilising his plantation. And with the business making a loss, he's deciding what his family will have to go without too. Argentina's multibillion dollar textile industry is also affected. Luciano Galfione, chairman of a non-profit for the sector Fundacion Pro Tejer, describes \"daily\" closures and job losses. Unlike Trump's approach of raising tariffs to promote \"America First\", Milei cut tariffs and other criteria for imports. \"I have environmental controls, labour controls - we don't pay people $80 (£60) a month, or have 16-hour work days that might be allowed in places like Bangladesh or Vietnam. This creates an unequal playing field,\" Mr Galfione argues. He believes that boosting imports has battered domestic producers. \"Our sector lost more than 10,000 direct jobs. If you add indirect jobs, there are many more.\" The Global Story: Trump is bailing out Argentina. What happened to 'America first'? Mr Galfione also blames rising costs of utilities, health and schools for reducing the disposable income of average people, and in turn making them less likely to buy clothes. And yet amid it all, Milei is adamant that his measures will improve the lives of ordinary Argentines. In the run-up to the election Milei had said there was no alternative to big cuts. As well as the soaring inflation, vast government subsidies had kept energy and transport prices down. Public spending was high, even before the Covid-19 pandemic. Price controls set fixed prices for certain goods. Argentina, still, owes £31bn in debt to the IMF. \"The demand for public spending was brutal,\" argues Ramiro Castiñeira, an economist at the consultancy Econométrica who supports Milei.  \"Society seemed willing to live with so much inflation. Or didn't recognise that inflation was a product of so much public spending.\" Inflation ate away the peso currency's purchasing power. Many ordinary Argentines handed over disproportionate sums of pesos to illegal street traders to buy dollars, fearing their money would lose value overnight. \"Everything was a huge mess,\" explains Martin Rapetti, an economics professor at the University of Buenos Aires and executive director of think tank Equilibria.  \"People felt money slipping like water through their fingers.\" For many economists, drastic change (even if painful) was essential to restore credibility. And Milei promised radical change. He went viral for ripping government ministries such as Culture and Women off a whiteboard while shouting 'afuera!' - 'out!' Among other austerity measures, he halved government ministries, cut tens of thousands of public jobs, slashed budgets including for education, health, pensions and infrastructure, and removed subsidies – spiking utility and transport prices. His initial devaluing of the peso by 50% caused inflation to spike but then it fell as people spent less and demand fell. When I met him in April 2024 at his office, there were sculptures of him with a chainsaw on display and coasters showing Margaret Thatcher's face. Thatcher is loathed by many people in Argentina owing to the Falklands War, but Milei told me he admired her and that she was \"brilliant.\" Last month one British newspaper described Milei's own approach as having \"echoes of Thatcherism\". Miguel Boggiano, an economist on Milei's economic advisory board, is full of praise for Milei getting inflation down and reducing the deficit. \"When you bear in mind the starting point, that's a huge accomplishment,\" he says. He believes this will help alleviate poverty in the long-run and enable lower taxes, but also help people to plan their own spending more easily with inflation currently fluctuating less. But Alan Cibils, an independent economist and former professor, warns reduced inflation is only a success if it is sustained over time which he believes will not be the case. Javier Milei is not a career politician. Before becoming president he had two years experience as a deputy in Argentina's Congress. \"Being so detached kind of shields him,\" Prof Rapetti observes, citing a lack of \"signs of empathy in public life\".  On 7 September Milei's party lost unexpectedly badly in the Buenos Aires provincial elections. His convoy was pelted with rocks on the campaign trail. The markets panicked: foreign investors sold off pesos and bonds of Argentine government debt. Financial markets had generally supported his economic programme. But the midterm elections were upcoming and the £15bn of debt repayments are due next year. Trump's £15bn currency swap lifeline has provided some stability: Argentine bonds and the peso rose in value in response to the announcement. But D'Alessandro argues that though US intervention might solve a wider problem, nothing will change in \"people's real lives\". \"We're going to continue with no investment in hospitals, education, social programmes. This money from the United States is not going to improve Argentina's infrastructure.\" Some of Milei's supporters - like Mr Boggiano - believe there is something else at play in the round criticism of the president: In this view much of it comes down to the opposition trying to \"break\" what Milei has done, in order to get back into power. \"Once everyone starts to believe stability is here to stay, investment will come back,\" says Mr Boggiano. \"I think Milei will become a model for other countries.\" Others are unsure. \"There is some stability which helps things not to explode,\" said Mr Cibils. \"But I think that stability is also a mirage.\" Milei had also kept inflation under control by spending the country's reserves on propping-up the peso so it didn't crash. Meanwhile, Argentina owes $20bn of debt next year. One former central bank economist, who wished to speak anonymously, warns Milei's strategy of keeping inflation down could unravel if Argentina can't pay its debts. \"If at the end of the day we have a financial crisis that partially undoes all the effort, then it's a failure. If it ends with social unrest, any good done will be reversed,\" says the economist. The left-wing governor of Buenos Aires, Axel Kicillof, has been touted as a future presidential candidate, long ahead of the elections in 2027. He has spoken in favour of the welfare state. Some investors are calculating whether this could mean a return to the days of big spending. As to the question of whether Milei has succeeded, the answer largely depends how you define success - and who it is for. Many workers see shuttered factories, rocketing bills, and a vanishing safety net. Meanwhile, some investors see a success story of fiscal discipline, tamed inflation, an ally in Washington and simply a \"normalisation\". But even as leaders abroad watch Milei's experiment with fascination, politics may explain why few are unlikely to copy it. If normal people lose faith in what he is doing, markets will also lose confidence that his programme is sustainable – and that could wipe out even the 'macro' successes. \"He has no political expertise, and I think you need it,\" Prof Rapetti argues. Still, he believes it is too early to judge: \"We are in the middle of his term… The story hasn't finished.\" Top picture credit: WPA Pool/Getty Images, Bloomberg via Getty Images BBC InDepth is the home on the website and app for the best analysis, with fresh perspectives that challenge assumptions and deep reporting on the biggest issues of the day.

      "Title: Why this month's inflation figure may be good news for you\n",
      "Date: Wed, 17 Dec 2025 14:18:10 GMT\n",
      "Content: On the face of it, there is relatively little festive cheer for your finances in the latest inflation figures. Prices have risen by 3.2% compared with a year ago. If you filled your virtual shopping bag with goods and services at a cost of £100 a year ago, the same selection will now cost £103.20. The rate of rising prices is well above the Bank of England's target of 2%, and some items are still rocketing up in price. Chocolate, arguably central to the family diet at Christmas, is 17% more expensive than a year ago. But, crucially, there are now clear signs that prices are going up at a slower rate. That bodes well for next year, and more immediately for the cost of borrowing. And, with essentials driving the slowdown, the latest data will be welcomed by those who feel particularly stretched by the cost of living. The rate of inflation, which charts the rising cost of living, has overcome its recent mini-peak, according to analysts. The mountainous height of inflation was in October 2022 when the rate hit 11.1%. The rate then fell, but there was an uptick in the late summer of 2025, reaching 3.8%. And it was the price of food - an essential for consumers - driving November's drop in inflation. Food and non-alcoholic drinks rose by 4.2% in the year to November, compared to 4.9% in October. Alcohol and tobacco were up 4% compared to 5.9% in October. Moving in the opposite direction to chocolate, and beef and veal (which rose by nearly 28% in a year), were olive oil (down 16%) as well as drops in price for flours, pasta and sugar. Importantly, food is essential spending. When the price rises slow, this is much better news for those on lower incomes who see a bigger proportion of their income spent on things that it is impossible to do without. Sarah Coles, head of personal finance at investment firm Hargreaves Lansdown, said this was also helping the overall inflation rate drop faster than expected: \"It has been following the path the Bank of England had forecast - peaking in September and gradually moving south.\" The reasons for slowing price rises are often specific to individual items. For example, the drop in the price of olive oil is primarily the result of a recovery in harvests after some particularly bad years of heatwaves and drought in Greece and Turkey. Clothing and footwear prices fell by 0.6% in the year to November compared to a rise of 0.3% in October. This has been linked to shops bringing forward Black Friday discounts due to weak sales as shoppers struggle with the cost of living pressures.  Consumers, too, have changed their habits owing to the financial climate of recent years. Lucy Fairs, who helps run a cake-sharing social club, called Band of Bakers in Camberwell, London, said that, over the last five years, they had started using what they already had in their cupboards, rather than buying extra special ingredients. \"When I chose a recipe for today, I thought of the theme - but, more so, I thought of what I already had in my pantry,\" said club member Costa Christou. The rising cost of goods and services has an impact on the money you save or earn. Inflation erodes the spending power of money you've got saved and - unless you get a pay rise - of your salary. Analysts say the latest inflation data strengthens the likelihood of a cut in interest rates by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee on Thursday. That should make it cheaper for consumers to borrow money, but bring lower returns for savers. \"Lower inflation is good news for household budgets, but it is a different story for savers,\" said Sally Conway, savings commentator at Shawbrook Bank.  \"Some savings will inevitably take a hit over Christmas. The key is what happens next. Once the dust settles, it's worth checking whether remaining cash is working hard enough.\" Policymakers are trying to encourage more people to invest their money in stocks and shares - which they say is likely to bring higher returns over time than cash savings. It is why the Financial Conduct Authority has given the go-ahead for targeted support - a scheme that, for the first time, allows banks and financial firms to give suggestions about where to invest your money. Additional reporting by Josh McMinn The rain and high winds experienced during stormy weather can damage homes and cause power outages. An increasing number of people cannot afford to heat their homes in winter, says a  charity boss. Paying parents directly for some childcare costs gives \"flexibility\", says a Jersey minister.  Trump's import levies are still changing the patterns of international trade. Wall Street investors have bought thousands of homes to rent out, a practice that has sparked concerns about affordability. Copyright 2026 BBC. All rights reserved.
